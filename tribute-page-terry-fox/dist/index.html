          <h3>What did Terry Fox do for Canada</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>July 28, 1958</strong> - Terrance Stanley Fox is born in Winnipeg, Manitoba.</li>
            <li><strong>March 9, 1977</strong> - Terry discovers he has a malignant tumour in his right leg; the leg is amputated 15 centimetres (six inches) above the knee. The night before his amputation he reads about an amputee runner and dreams of running.</li>
            <li><strong>February 1979</strong> - Terry begins training for his Marathon of Hope, a cross-Canada run to raise money for cancer research and awareness. During his training he runs over 5,000 kilometres (3,107 miles).</li>
            <li><strong>April 12, 1980</strong> - St John’s, Newfoundland: Terry dips his artificial leg into the Atlantic Ocean and begins his odyssey. He runs an average of 42 kilometres a day (26 miles) through six provinces.</li>        
            <li><strong>September 1, 1980</strong> - After 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 miles) Terry stopped running outside of Thunder Bay, Ontario; his primary cancer had spread to his lungs. Before returning to BC for treatment Terry said, “I’m gonna do my very best. I’ll fight. I promise I won’t give up.”</li>        
            <li><strong>February 1, 1981</strong> - Terry’s hope of raising $1 from every Canadian to fight cancer is realized. The national population reaches 24.1 million; the Terry Fox Marathon of Hope fund totals $24.17 million.</li>      
            <li><strong>June 28, 1981</strong> - After treatment with chemotherapy and interferon, Terry Fox dies at Royal Columbian Hospital, New Westminster, British Columbia – one month short of his twenty-third birthday.</li>        
            <li><strong>September 13, 1981</strong> - The first Terry Fox Run is held at more than 760 sites in Canada and around the world. The event attracts 300,000 participants and raises $3.5 million.</li>
