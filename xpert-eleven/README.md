# Xpert Eleven 

## Translation work done

As someone who has been a fan of football (soccer) my whole life, I have signed up on Xpert Eleven, a virtual football manager website back in 2006.

At that time, Google Translator was not as popular as it is nowadays, so I have offered my knowledge of both English and Serbian to translate whole website in Serbian.

This project took few months to finish because at that point I did not have time to focus on this full time but it was definitely worth every hour I spent on it because it brought a lot of users to the website since they could actually read stuff in the language they understand.
